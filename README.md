# Interactive Development Assignment

This website was made as part of my Interactive Development module assignment. HTML, CSS and JavaScript was used as part of the assignment. 

Due to issues with github and bitbucket, this repository is not the original repository that I started off with. For the purpose of showcasing how I made use of github with proper documentation and commits, here is the link to the original repository.

## Background

This website was created from the point of view of Zhou Shen's Studio. The goal of the website is to let visitors find out more about Zhou Shen, as well as let them listen to his songs. 

## Pages

There are 5 pages in the website as follows: 
- Homepage

  - A form to send messages is also available along with his social links.

- 勤深深 page

## Conclusion

Though this website is simple, it was made to just as a place to allow fans to find out more. It is NOT meant as a sales platform, especially as Zhou Shen is known to not place focus on profits, and still holds a free livestream every year on his birthday as thanks for the support from his fans, with each livestream lasting up to 4 hours.
